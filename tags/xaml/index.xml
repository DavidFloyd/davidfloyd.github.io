      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on a UWP app for a cable TV company. The app allows their clients to watch the TV channels they are subscribed to with additional information like the TV schedule, information about TV shows, recording TV shows for watching later, etc. One of the main functionalities of the app is a TV schedule grid. Creating this TV schedule grid in UWP is not so easy, especially because of the poor XAML rendering performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tv-schedule-grid&#34;&gt;TV schedule grid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TV schedule grid shows a TV schedule for all the subscribed channels for a given day. The channels are being shown in rows and the columns represent TV shows. The grid is scrollable in both directions and the channel logos are sticky. The users can be subscribed up 70 channels and all of this should work reasonably well even on a Windows Phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how the result looks in a Windows Phone emulator. Spoiler: there is just no way to make it so smooth on a real Windows Phone device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/tvgrid.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;pure-img&#34; &gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;xaml-controls&#34;&gt;XAML controls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first and obvious approach to implement the TV schedule grid was to use native XAML controls. The &lt;code&gt;ScrollViewer&lt;/code&gt; control got a handy &lt;code&gt;LeftHeader&lt;/code&gt; property in UWP making implementing the sticky channels logos easy. The problem with &lt;code&gt;ScrollViewer&lt;/code&gt; is it does not support virtualization. If you create something like a huge &lt;code&gt;Grid&lt;/code&gt; with all the data and put into the &lt;code&gt;ScrollViewer&lt;/code&gt; the app will crash because of memory constrains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can create a &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;GridView&lt;/code&gt; and use it to display rows and put another one into each row to show columns. You will gain virtualization that works, your app will not crash because of memory but the scrolling performance will be abysmal. The users will notice the virtualization manifesting itself as appearing and disappearing rows and columns resulting in very poor user experience. When you have a vertical &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; where each row represents a TV channel containing another horizontal &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt; with the TV shows, then you have to face another hard problem. When the user scrolls horizontally in a row, you need all the other rows to scroll to the same horizontal position so the TV schedule stays in sync. Try syncing horizontal &lt;code&gt;ListViews&lt;/code&gt; in a virtualized vertical &lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt;, I dare you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt; When I was trying out this solution I tried phasing as suggested by Tim Heuer in the comments. Instead of seeing empty gaps in the TV schedule when scrolling, as the result of virtualization, I sometimes saw TV show borders instead. It was better but still not good enough, the perceived performance did not improve much. And there was still the hard problem of syncing the horizontal &lt;code&gt;ListViews&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last idea was to put a big &lt;code&gt;Canvas&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;ScrollViewer&lt;/code&gt; and render only what is currently in view. This is the way the Radaee PDF I use in another project does PDF rendering. You can add XAML controls to the &lt;code&gt;Canvas&lt;/code&gt;, remove them when they are not in view anymore. This is quite laborious and the resulting performance is still not very good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use the &lt;code&gt;Canvas&lt;/code&gt; as a canvas and draw primitives instead of using XAML controls. It is not very comfortable, it is quite low level stuff. Thinking about using such a low level solution made me think of Win2D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;win2d&#34;&gt;Win2D&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Win2D is an easy-to-use Windows Runtime API for immediate mode 2D graphics rendering with GPU acceleration. It is available to C# and C++ developers writing Windows apps for Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 10. It utilizes the power of Direct2D, and integrates seamlessly with XAML and CoreWindow. I have some experience with Win2D, I &lt;a href=&#34;../../creating-a-simple-windows-10-game-with-win2d&#34;&gt;used it when creating my retro Sokoban game&lt;/a&gt;. So I gave it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Win2D is a really low level API. This means I had to do a lot of math to compute what is currently in view and where to render it. Rendering TV shows is also not easy, you have to render the cell using rectangles, lines, etc. At least Win2D makes drawing texts relatively easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing to solve was scrolling the Win2D canvas. Capturing gestures and mouse movements on a XAML control is not easy, so I came up with another solution. I put a transparent &lt;code&gt;ScrollViewer&lt;/code&gt; over the Win2D grid making the Win2D canvas redraw when the &lt;code&gt;ViewChanged&lt;/code&gt; event fires. The math in the rendering logic takes the &lt;code&gt;ScrollViewer&lt;/code&gt; scroll positions into account to correctly determine what is currently in view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;performance-tuning&#34;&gt;Performance tuning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lot of work this solution worked, rendered what I wanted it to. The performance seemed good in a Windows Phone emulator but when I tried it on a real phone I was disappointed. The performance was still quite bad. I found out rendering the texts is the slowest part, so the idea was to cache the texts or even better the whole cells by TV show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Win2D supports &lt;a href=&#34;https://microsoft.github.io/Win2D/html/Offscreen.htm&#34;&gt;offscreen drawing&lt;/a&gt;. This means you can render something into a texture and the use the texture instead of drawing it again, making it ideal as a form of caching. When rendering the cell of a TV show for the first time, I do not render it directly to the Win2D canvas but instead into a texture. I then add the rendered texture into a in-memory dictionary and draw it to the Win2D canvas. When I need to render the TV show cell again (when the users scrolls the TV schedule grid and the TV show is in view) I just render the texture again. This means you render each show with its multiple texts just once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving cache invalidation is quite easy in this case, the texture becomes invalid only when the TV show it represents becomes active (meaning it is currently being broadcasted on a given channel making it gray) or inactive (black). Of course you cannot cache everything, only a certain number of textures, but it is easily solved by setting a limit on the number of cached textures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this performance improvement the TV schedule grid became quite tolerable on a Lumia 950, but still slow on a Lumia 750. Sadly, there was nothing else I could do about it. I asked about it on Twitter and found another developer who implemented a TV schedule grid in his app. He also used Win2D but just omitted it from the phone version, because of performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating something like a TV schedule grid in UWP with good performance is simply impossible using XAML controls. You can use Win2D to gain some performance but the result is still not exactly great on Windows Phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Microsoft XAML apps suffer from poor rendering performance. Just take a look at the list in the Add or remove programs section of Windows 10 settings. This is how it behaves on ma quad-core i5, 16 GB RAM and GTX 660.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;When clients tell you your &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/uwp?src=hash&#34;&gt;#uwp&lt;/a&gt; app is slow and lists lag, just show them how Microsoft does it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Windows10?src=hash&#34;&gt;#Windows10&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing better you can do. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/rnDWLFEHeb&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/rnDWLFEHeb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Igor Kulman (@igorkulman) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/igorkulman/status/818938357275328514&#34;&gt;January 10, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft cannot create a well-performing lists in XAML and UWP, you as a developer cannot do much better no matter how hard you try.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mobilize.net: Converting Windows Phone 8 apps to UWP? Not really</title>
      <link>/mobilize-net-converting-windows-phone-apps-to-uwp/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Dec 2015 09:29:12 +0100</pubDate>

      <guid>/mobilize-net-converting-windows-phone-apps-to-uwp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft announced the Windows 10 developer platform, they also announced bridges to make porting apps from Android, iOS and Web easier. Those bridges are now either dead (Android) or unusable (iOS) but there is another tool that can be considered a bridge left. It is called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobilize.net/download-silverlight-bridge&#34;&gt;Mobilize.net Silverlight&lt;/a&gt; Bridge and it is not from Microsoft. It promises converting existing Windows Phone 8 (Silverlight apps) to the Universal Windows Platform. Considering the majority of apps in the Windows Phone Store are Windows Phone 8 apps and the fact that Android and iOS developers do not really care about Windows, Mobilize.net seem to be the most useful of the bridges, because there is no easy porting apps from Windows Phone 8 to UWP, just rewriting. So I tried it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/Windows10-Devices.png?t=1449725816496&amp;amp;width=425&amp;amp;height=210&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;pure-img&#34; &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobilize.net is currently in technical preview. After you download and install it, it integrates into Visual Studio 2015 and there is a new context menu for Windows Phone 8 project, allowing you to convert them to UWP apps. If you use it, you get a dialog windows and a conversion process that will fail most of the times with a strange error. At least for me it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got in touch with their support and I found out the reason for the conversion always failing. They do not support C# 6 all and mine, and probably all yours, project use C# 6. If you look at the error logs a bit closer, you will see error messages about failed tokenization. This is really strange, it looks like they are parsing the source code as text, instead of just using Roslyn. I do not get why, but they probably have a reason for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go through all the trouble and remove all the C# 6 features from your project, the conversion will succeed. You will get a UWP project, that will most likely not compile. There are two main reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mobilize.net changes your XAML to fix namespaces and replace controls that changed since Windows Phone 8, but it does not fix XAML features that were not available in UWP. And there are quite a few of them, from StringFormat in bindings to OpacityMask on images. You will have to fix your XAML manually and while you are at this, you will also have to rewrite your XAML to accommodate for the fact that there is not just one fixed resolution like it was in Windows Phone 8. Your XAML has to be responsive now. Mobilize.net did not really help here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seconds problem are third party libraries. There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/MobilizeNet/UWPConversionMappings&#34;&gt;some mappings available for popular third party libraries&lt;/a&gt;. This mapping do two things. First they make sure the UWP project uses the correct Nuget packages and then they map namespaces, both in XAML and C#, that changed when the third party library transitioned from Windows Phone 8 to UWP. Chances are that there are no UWP versions of some or even the majority of the third party libraries you use. Probably because the functionality is nor longer available all the API has completely changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out to the Mobilize.net support asking about these two things, but I never got an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, if your app is not trivial, you use C# 6, third party libraries and all the available XAML features, your experience will not be very good. If you app is well written (MVVM, abstractions) your are better with creating a new UWP project, pasting your code and rewriting your XAML. If your app is more trivial, Mobilize.net will probably work well for you. But in this case, rewriting your app to UWP without it would be probably takes the same amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Detecting gestures over WebView on Windows Phone</title>
      <link>/detecting-gestures-over-webview-on-windows-phone/</link>

      <guid>/detecting-gestures-over-webview-on-windows-phone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you develop Windows Phone apps, you surely had to use the WebView component at least once. Any you must have realized, that it kind of sucks. One of the problems is that it swallows all the gestures and manipulation events. This means you cannot put it into a Pivot, you cannot detect swipe left or right events to navigate to next or previous article .. or can you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent project, I had to implement exactly the mentioned functionality, swiping between articles displayed in a WebView. I did some research and I could not find any solution. So I had to get creative and I find a way involving JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea was simple. If you cannot recognize the swipe event over the WebView in your C#/XAML, why not try to recognize them in the WebView? I did some research and found a JavaScript library that works on Windows Phone. The library is &lt;a href=&#34;https://hammerjs.github.io/&#34;&gt;Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and it recognizes all the basic gestures, including swiping left and right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you include Hammer into your HTML, then you set it up to listen over an HTML element and lastly you subscribe to events you are interested in. The only reasonable action you can execute is notify the WebView using the &lt;code&gt;window.external.notify&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-gist=&#34;f7c559775ef3e57906ed&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C#/XAML part of the solution consists just of handling the WebView&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;ScriptNotify&lt;/code&gt; event and implementing your action according to the value you receive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Highlighting letters in TextBlock in Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1</title>
      <link>/highlighting-letters-in-textblock-in-windows-phone-8-1-and-windows-8-1/</link>

      <guid>/highlighting-letters-in-textblock-in-windows-phone-8-1-and-windows-8-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my current project I had to implement an interesting feature for both Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1 project of the Universal app. The idea is simply. The users want to search for a movie. They enter a search term into a TextBox and a list of results is shown. The results should have the search term highlighted in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/highlighting.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;pure-img&#34; &gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard TextBlock used to display the movie titles does not support any kind of letter highlighting, so I had to write a custom one. I created a custom UserControl. The UserControl contains a few dependency properties Text, HighlightedText, HighlightBrush and a TextBlock. When Text or HighlightedText change, the Text is then split into multiple Runs that are added to the TextBlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-gist=&#34;87b051f2f3a54bf895f0&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole working custom control is available at Github: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WPA81.HighlightTextBox&#34;&gt;https://github.com/igorkulman/Kulman.WPA81.HighlightTextBox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I came upon a really bizarre problem that you may also find interesting. Lets start with a bit of context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tl;Dr&lt;/strong&gt;: There seems to be a bug in Windows phone 8.1 that can make your app and the phone freezes when displaying images over HTTPS from some servers. Skip to &lt;a href=&#34;#bug&#34;&gt;the end of this article&lt;/a&gt; to see a video and get the source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Windows Phone app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is a Windows Phone 8 shopping app for the biggest Czech online retailer. The main screen of the app contains quite a bit of data, usually about ten carousel with about 10 products and the list of main categories, so about 10 more images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In worst case the main screen contains over 10 hundred images. It was quite a hassle to make it work well in the Windows Phone 8 SDK (no, rewriting a shopping about with about 70 screens to Windows Phone 8.1 is not feasible). But it work juts fine. Until last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, users started to report that the app freezes on the main screen, sometime making the whole phone freeze. This was really bad. Frozen app means not only angry customers but customer that do not buy stuff. So I started to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I thought there may be a problem in the app, although the app was last updated more than a month ago and the problem started only last week. Everything worked fine in the emulator, the problem was reproducible only on real devices. I tried showing only one carousel to make the app render much less data, did not help. I tried making the app show only one product in the only one carousel, still a problem. So it looked like the images were the problem. I tried replacing all the real image urls with random images from &lt;a href=&#34;http://lorempixel.com&#34;&gt;lorempixel.com&lt;/a&gt; and the app worked just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I determined that the source of the problems are the images on the server. Talking with the server customer&amp;#8217;s people I found out that the images on the server were exchanged for bigger one because of the iPhones. But it did not make sense. I tried using much bigger random images and the app worked fine. I tried downloading the images and using them locally, the app worked fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong id=&#34;bug&#34;&gt;Windows Phone 8.1 bug?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I found out that the app worked the whole time on phones with Windows 10, only phones with Windows Phone 8.1 were affected. Android and iOS apps that the customer has also never experienced this problem. This make me thing that there is some kind of bug in Windows Phone 8.1 that causes this behavior, because the app does not do any image processing, it only uses an Image control and sets is Source url.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample app to reproduce the problem: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/igorkulman/WindowsPhoneHttpsImageBug&#34;&gt;https://github.com/igorkulman/WindowsPhoneHttpsImageBug&lt;/a&gt;. The solution contains a Windows Phone 8 project and a Windows Phone 8.1. Both apps suffer from the sample problem, but the problem is worse in the Silverlight app. This also makes me think that this is a Windows Phone 8.1 bug, independent on the Windows Phone SDK version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a video using the sample app showing the problem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;embed video-player&#34;&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/138747871&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;385&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      <title>Implementing Google login in Universal Apps</title>
      <link>/implementing-google-login-in-universal-apps/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>/implementing-google-login-in-universal-apps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent project I had to implement Google login to an Universal App. I decided to use the native &lt;a href=&#34;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows.security.authentication.web.webauthenticationbroker.aspx&#34;&gt;WebAuthenticationBroker&lt;/a&gt; control and the implementation was not as straightforward as I hoped. By implementing Google login I mean getting the authentication token that you can then use with your server API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WebAuthenticationBroker is a good idea but it is implemented rather poorly. It works differently on Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 due to the &amp;#8220;AndContinue&amp;#8221; pattern that Windows Phone 8.1 forces on you. You can solve this with &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.kulman.sk/why-universal-apps-as-not-as-universal-as-you-may-think/&#34;&gt;some ifdefs and platform specific code, as always&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real problem s that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Web-Authentication-d0485122&#34;&gt;MSDN sample&lt;/a&gt; states it works with Google login but it does not. The sample thinks it gets the authentication token but it does not, it just gets the success code that you have to exchange for the authentication token yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets start with a basic config&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-gist=&#34;65a406f7f3cff48be3c5&#34; data-file=&#34;config.cs&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important things here are your Google app id and Google app secret. The GoogleStartUri also contains permissions that you want to get (profile, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login&#34;&gt;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.me&#34;&gt;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.me&lt;/a&gt; email in my case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You use this config with a WebAuthenticationBroker call&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-gist=&#34;65a406f7f3cff48be3c5&#34; data-file=&#34;login.cs&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on Windows 8.1 you get the response data immediately. On Windows Phone 8.1, you have to implement the &amp;#8220;AndContinue&amp;#8221; pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You use the response data to parse out the success code&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-gist=&#34;65a406f7f3cff48be3c5&#34; data-file=&#34;GetGoogleSuccessCode.cs&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have the success code, you can exchange it for the authentication token&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now you finally have a way to get the authentication token and implement Google login.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-gist=&#34;65a406f7f3cff48be3c5&#34; data-file=&#34;GetToken.cs&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using RESX files is the standard approach to Windows Phone 8 app localization, it is even contained in the standard project templates. When you work on a project for a longer time, you may get to a situation that your RESX files contain strings that you no longer use. This is a problem especially when you want to add a new localization, because it is slower and kind of wasteful localizing unused strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem I have created a simple command line utility, that is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/igorkulman/RemoveUnusedResources&#34;&gt;available at Github&lt;/a&gt;. This utility assumes that you use the standard localization approach from the templates (AppResources.{lang}.resx and LocalizedStrings.{value} in XAML).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usage is really simple. Just run the utility with the path to your project as a parameter. It will detect all resources files and remove all the unused strings from them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last article I gave you a tip on how to localize the Player Framework, in this article I will show you have to customize the UI of the actual player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to obtain the Generic.xaml file that the Player Framework uses for styling. You can find it in C:\ Program Files (x86)\ Microsoft SDKs\ Windows\ v8.0\ ExtensionSDKs\ Microsoft.PlayerFramework.Xaml\ 2.0.0.0\ Redist\ CommonConfiguration\ neutral\ Microsoft.PlayerFramework\ Themes. Copy it to your projects and rename it to something more telling, like PlayerFramework.xaml.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now edit the copied XAML file and customize it any way you want. If you do the styling for a Windows Phone app, keep in mind that the ControlPanel switches to the Compact states and a few transformations are applied by default, that can interfere with your styling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you need to apply the style by adding it to the page with your player&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The death of the WinRT developer?</title>

      <guid>/the-death-of-the-winrt-developer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As many other Windows Phone / Windows 8 / Universal apps developers (lets just call us WinRT developers) I watched the Build 2015 keynote last night. And I did not like it. I know Microsoft does not know to communicate but the message for me was clear. We, the WinRT developer, are no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Microsoft announced that WPF apps will be allowed to be submitted to the Windows Store to be used on desktops / tablets. So why would anyone want to develop (or want to have developed) a Windows 8 (WinRT) app, when they can just use WPF and get everything done easier? I do not know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But allowing WPF apps to the Windows Store is a small news compared to the ability to run Android apps on Windows Phone. The first news talked about porting Android apps to the Windows Phone, but later, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-microsoft-hopes-to-get-android-and-ios-phone-apps-into-its-windows-10-store/&#34;&gt;statements like this&lt;/a&gt; appeared&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android developers will be able to submit versions of their apps, written in Java or C++, to the Windows Store in he form of APKs and have those apps work on Windows Phone 10 devices. Android developers should be able to start submitting apps to the Windows 10 Store some time in the next few months.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let get this straight. Who would want a native mobile Windows app developed, when they can just take their Android app and use it on Windows? What company would want to keep their mobile Windows team, when they can just use their Android team to make Windows apps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; width=&#34;550&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
    So I can use WPF to get into the store, and Java to get onto WinPhone and Android. So why would I write a universal app???
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, Android apps will probably not run on XBOX and HoloLens, but I doubt Microsoft will open the XBOX store for all the developers, more likely only chosen companies will be allowed to publish apps. HoloLens will be used only by a small number of people if this price is not really low (which I doubt it will be), so only a few HoloLens apps will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the situation seems clear, it is the death of the WinRT developer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Player Framework localization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my recent universal (Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1) project I implemented PlayReady DRM protected smooth streaming movies playback using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://playerframework.codeplex.com/&#34;&gt;Player Framework&lt;/a&gt;. This projects seems to be dead, but it is still the best option when implementing any kind of video playback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I had to do was localize it&amp;#8217;s controls, because the app I worked on was in Czech and Slovak, not in English (the only language the Player Framework supports out of the box). Not all the texts an be localized, but the most visible ones like button labels and error messages can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create your own localization, I suggest you create a new RESW file in your project. You can use and existing one, but I prefer to separate the texts for the Player Framework from texts for the rest of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next you have to find out the keys for the string you want to localize. You an &lt;a href=&#34;https://playerframework.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#Win8.Xaml.Localize.Win81/en-US/PlayerFramework.resw&#34;&gt;find them in the source code&lt;/a&gt;. You can just copy the content of that RESW file to yours RESW file and localized everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last step is to let the PlayerFramework know about your RESW file using&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changing the PivotItem header color in Windows Phone 8.1 XAML</title>
      <link>/changing-the-pivotitem-header-color-in-windows-phone-8-1-xaml/</link>

      <guid>/changing-the-pivotitem-header-color-in-windows-phone-8-1-xaml/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 8.1 XAML contains a Pivot control that looks like the one from Windows Phone &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and also should behave the same way, but does not. You will find the first problem with the new Pivot when you want to change the PivotItem header color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows Phone &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to change the PivotItem header color in Windows Phone &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, you just define the color in the Header template:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-gist=&#34;a49d0c7d471c4de42521&#34; data-file=&#34;wp8.xaml&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works great, changing the color of the active PivotItem Header to the color you want and applying some opacity to the inactive PivotItem Headers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/header78.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;pure-img&#34; &gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows Phone 8.1 XAML&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you apply the same Header template to PivotItem in Windows Phone 8.1 XAML, you will find that there is a bug in the control. The inactive PivotItem Headers do not get opacity change applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/header81.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;pure-img&#34; &gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is obviously a problem, if you do not want to do same SelectedIndex manipulation to change the color programatically for all the inactive PivotItem headers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there is a way to fix this. You can redefine the PivotHeaderForegroundUnselectedBrush and PivotHeaderForegroundSelectedBrush to the active and inactive colors of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-gist=&#34;a49d0c7d471c4de42521&#34; data-file=&#34;wp81.xaml&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Dialog helper for Universal Apps the easy way</title>

      <guid>/dialog-helper-for-universal-apps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I read Joost van Schaik&amp;#8217;s blog post called &lt;a href=&#34;http://dotnetbyexample.blogspot.nl/2014/12/a-behavior-to-show-messagedialog-from.html&#34;&gt;A behavior to show a MessageDialog from a MVVMLight viewmodel in Universal apps–with callbacks&lt;/a&gt;. I am not a MVVMLight guy (I use Caliburn.Micro) and I personally use an approach that uses a little less code, employing a helper class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helper class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-gist=&#34;fda1860b35d5312e9157&#34; data-file=&#34;DialogHelper.cs&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with a simple usage in ViewModel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-gist=&#34;fda1860b35d5312e9157&#34; data-file=&#34;usage.cs&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and in the View (making use of Caliburn.Micro mapping the AppBarButton with x:Name=&amp;#8221;Message&amp;#8221; to the Message method in the ViewModel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-gist=&#34;fda1860b35d5312e9157&#34; data-file=&#34;usage.xaml&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to show a dialog with just the Ok button, set cancelText to null and do not process the helper method&amp;#8217;s result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not like static classes, just make it service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-gist=&#34;fda1860b35d5312e9157&#34; data-file=&#34;DialogHelperService.cs&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the usage in the ViewModel will change just slightly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-gist=&#34;fda1860b35d5312e9157&#34; data-file=&#34;usage2.cs&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and you can easily mock the service and test the ViewModel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the complete code in a sample solution on GitHub: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/igorkulman/SampleMessagePopup&#34;&gt;https://github.com/igorkulman/SampleMessagePopup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Creating a fake splashscreen for your Universal App</title>
      <link>/creating-a-fake-splashscreen-for-your-universal-app/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>/creating-a-fake-splashscreen-for-your-universal-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you may want your app to display the startup splashscreen a bit longer, so you can initialize or fetch some data necessary for the app to run. To achieve this, you can create a fake splaschreen, a View that looks just like the splashscreen, does all the work and redirects to the real main View afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, it is quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a SplashScreenView with just the right background and the splashscreen image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the app to display SplashScreenView at startup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do all the initializing and data fetching in SplashScreenViewModel and redirect to there real MainView&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works quite well with Windows 8.1, but on Windows Phone 8.1 there is a problem. When you run the Windows Phone 8.1 app, you will see a page transition happen between the real splashscreen and your SplashScreenView. This looks strange, so it is better to get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing the Frame transitions on Windows Phone 8.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix this issue, you can disable the transitions on the frame and add them manually to each View other than SplashScreenView, but there is a better way. You can disable the transitions when creating the frame and the enable them after navigating from the SplashScreenView. Do not forget the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.kulman.sk/why-universal-apps-as-not-as-universal-as-you-may-think/&#34; title=&#34;Why Universal Apps as not as universal as you may think&#34;&gt;#ifdefs, because it is one of those many things that are Windows Phone specific in the Universal Apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div data-gist=&#34;d61c0a71e8ed0e2fbc1d&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes the illusion of the fake splashscreen perfect, but I would recommend adding a ProgressBar or ProgressRing to the SplashScreenView so the users do not have the feeling that your app froze.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/why-universal-apps-as-not-as-universal-as-you-may-think/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been developing Windows Phone apps for a few years now, always sticking to Silverlight and keeping using Silverlight also after Microsoft announced the WinRT flavor of Windows Phone apps and the so called Universal Apps. The Windows Phone 8.0 and 8.1 Silverlight APIs have some limitations, but are now well known do not contain many bugs. They are the safe choice if you want to create a Windows Phone apps. And do not forget that there are still many device running Windows Phone 8 (like Verizon customers in the US) that never got the 8.1 updated promised to everyone during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Really universal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 8.1 XAML and Universal Apps included WinRT APIs that have many problems, including some that there is no solution for. I used the WinRT APIs when creating first Windows 8 apps about 2 years ago, so I am not new to the APIs. I have not touched the WinRT APIs again until recently, because there was no demand for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 apps. Why would it? People use Windows 8 or 8.1 but do not care about Metro apps, they give them no value compared to &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; Win32 and Windows tablets are practically non-exists (expect for the Surface tablets owned by few programmers and maybe no one else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universal Apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, a client was thinking about adding a Windows Phone app for their service the its existing Android and iOS apps, but they did not think it was worth the money. So the local Microsoft branch told them they would pay for the app (seems like many of the app here are created this way) under two conditions. The app had to be a Universal App and had to be finished before the years end. The client agreed and I had to create a Universal App. And the problems started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, Universal Apps are supposed to make code sharing between Windows Phone and Windows 8.1 simple and allow you to reuse as much code as possible. This works on the trivial Microsoft samples, but try to create a real world app. I have a business logic project with API calls, storage, etc. in a portable class library (like I always did before Universal Apps existed) and I created an Universal App from the template. And the #ifdef hell started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;../../images/56995992.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;pure-img&#34; &gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#ifdefs everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Universal Apps you can safely share the ViewModels (I am using Caliburn.Micro) .. and that is about it. You have to create separate Views (because on phone and desktop information is typically displayed different), but the worst parts are the #ifdefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to set some properties of the main Frame, you have to use #ifdefs because the frame is a bit different on phone and desktop (like animations). You want to reuse as much DataTemplates as possible, so add another #ifdef for adding the right resource dictionary or many #ifdefs in the data templates to tune them, because it does not matter you use GridView on phone and GridView on desktop, they behave a bit differently in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you need to add audio playback to your app. There is a background audio playback API for Windows Phone 8.1 and none for Windows 8.1 In Windows 8.1 you need a global MediaElement in your Frame and handling everything differently. So add another big #ifdef. And by the way, the background audio playback API for Windows Phone 8.1 really sucks compared to the old Silverlight APIs. Just try downloading the &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/BackgroundAudio-63bbc319&#34;&gt;sample form MSDN&lt;/a&gt; and hitting Suspend and Resume in Visual Studio, the background agent crashes horribly, without any exception and takes your Visual Studio instance to hell with it. And of course, the background audio playback API does not work on some phones. &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26175599/windows-phone-8-1-rt-backgroundmediaplayer-not-working&#34;&gt;Just does not work&lt;/a&gt;. I confirmed this finding with other developers. Another messed up API that used to work before the whole Universal Apps hype. And explain this to the client who sees that things like this work on iOS, work on Android, hell, they even for on Windows Phone 8.0 (Slivelight) apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More messed up APIs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So background audio playback API for Windows Phone 8.1 is messed up, anything else? Sure. BackgroundDownloader is another example. In Silverlight, there was a BackgroundDownloader that was quite limited, but it worked. In Universal Apps, there is a new BackgroundDownloader with some new features, and some essential ones missing. For example, in Silverlight, each download could have a Tag, where you can store any data so you know something about the download when it finishes (to what business entity it belongs, etc.). Not any more in Universal Apps. There is no Tag, so you have to build and manage you own kind of index for all the downloads, so you can actually match them to your business entities. An annoyance, but nothing you cannot manage, right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BackgroundDownloader in Universal Apps has a bigger problem. It sometimes crashes so horribly, that it reboots the whole device! No exception, no logs, just a reboot. The maximum limit for the BackgroundDownloader is 1000 downloads, but try adding say 300 to the queue, cancelling them after a few minutes (does not seem to matter if you use one cancellation token or give each download its own) and there is a good chance the phone or the emulator will reboot itself. Not always, but quite often. Again, try explaining this issue to the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Silverlight, I commonly used the LongListSelector to display data, using it with a WrapPanel when I needed to create a two column layout. The LongListSelector is gone, in Universal Apps you have to use GridView also on Windows Phone. Or you can use the ListView with a custom wrap panel you write yourself or download somewhere, but it takes some effort to make it do virtualization properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you use GridView on both Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1 to make it consistent. Add tens f of items with images to it and the performance starts to really suffer. Gray placeholders will show up and more importantly, &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27488201/gridview-and-placeholders-that-never-disapper-in-windows-8-and-windows-phone-app&#34;&gt;never disappears&lt;/a&gt;. You do not event need images, just add about 300 text only items to the GridView and the gray placeholders will starts to show when scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need another proof that the WinRT controls are slower? Just &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn5hVq6Q-zo&#34;&gt;take a look at this video comparing the media app on and old Windows Phone 7 to the media app on a much more powerful device running Windows Phone 8.1&lt;/a&gt;. You can see that the old, single core device runs the Silverlight apps faster than the new powerful phone runs the new WinRT equivalent of the app.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/visual-studio-template-for-caliburn-micro-windows-phone-apps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been building Windows Phone apps using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Caliburn-Micro/Caliburn.Micro&#34;&gt;Caliburn.Micro&lt;/a&gt; framework for some time now. Setting up a new project takes some time and can be easily automated, so I decided to create a Visual Studio template for Windows Phone apps build with Caliburn.Micro.&lt;/p&gt;
