              When I released version 2.0 of my app Photo Timeline, some users reported updating problems. I finally found out what caused the problem and submited a new build to the Windows Phone store.
In my app I had three localizations: en-US (default), en and cs. I do not exactly remember why I had English twice as localization. I decided to remove the en localization thinking that nothing will break and that was a mistake.

              <p>I have been a Windows Phone developer for over a year now and my paid apps made me some money. The small amount of money made is not interesting, more interesting is that getting the money from Microsoft has been a real pain. Maybe because I live <strong>outside the US</strong>, maybe it is a geographically independent problem. If you are a developer and live outside the US, I really want to hear your experience.</p>

<p><strong>No exact info about payment rules?</strong></p>

<p>First, there is no exact information about how often a developer gets paid. The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/help/jj206722(v=vs.105).aspx">getting paid section</a> in the Windows Phone Dev Center only informs you about tax and bank info, that you need to provide to get paid. I remember that I once heard that developers get paid when their earnings get pass $200, but I was not able to get any official info about this. The first payment I got from Windows Phone Store was $52.50 and I know a developer with $900 earned and no money sent to him, so I guess the $200 limit is not true.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj193593.aspx">$200 limit should be true for Windows Store</a>, but Windows Phone Store is a different store with different rules.</p>

              <p>If you create a Windows Phone app and you want it to be able to run on both Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8, you target Windows Phone 7 and the app runs on Windows Phone 8 automatically. But is it really enough to create a Windows Phone 7 bu√≠ld? Not if you want to create a really well designed app.</p>

<p>The problem with Windows Phone 8 from a designers point of view is that it introduces two new display resolutions. Windows Phone 7 supports just one resolution, WVGA of 800x480px. Windows Phone 8 adds WXGA (1280&#215;768) and 720p (1280&#215;720). If you run your Windows Phone 7 app on a WXGA device, the app is proportionally scaled by a factor of 1.6 to fill out the whole screen. As long as you provide all your images scaled by the same factor, the app looks ok.</p>

<p>The problem is 720p, because it is a different aspect ratio (16:9 vs 15:9). Your Windows Phone 7 app running on a 720p app is first scaled by a factor of 1.5 to 1200&#215;720 and the rest of the display (80px) is padded on top or bottom, depending on the VerticalAlignment. By default, the padding is added to the top of your app making your header 80px higher:</p>

              <p>I am a big fan of open-source software. I decided to make my mini-libraries, that I use for Windows Phone and Windows 8 development, available to everyone who would be interested. Both are basically a collection of useful utilities and components that I wrote myself or found on various forums and slightly modified. Source code is available on BitBucket and packages on Nuget.</p>

              <p>Passing the certification in Windows Phone Store and Windows Store can be a very painful process, but after a few tries you get enough experience to pass your apps on the first try. You may sometimes get a tester who is really dumb and fails your app for a made up reason but usually it is just enough to submit it again so another testers gets to test it. Lately I have been seeing a strange shift in the testing quality done in the certification process.</p>

<p><strong>Windows Phone Store</strong></p>

<p>The certification process used to discover bugs I overlooked, so it was quite useful sometimes. But it is not anymore. Let me give you an example. I wanted to change one of my Windows Phone apps from free to paid with a 3 day trial. I have this functionality implemented in another of my apps so I simply copied the trial page, set is as the start page. I tested it in trial mode, it showed, in purchased mode, the app showed the real start page. I was under the impression that everything worked just fine.</p>

              <p>Windows Phone allows yout to use custom TTF fonts in your apps. Using a custom font from XAML or C# is easy, but your run into troubles when you want to use if from a Background Agent (e.g: for updating a Live Tile).</p>

<p><strong>Adding font to solution</strong></p>

<p>The custom font must be a TTF, you can also use a ZIP file with multiple TTF files. You need to know the name of the font to identify it. Add the font file to your solution and set its build action to Content.</p>

<p><strong>Custom font and XAML</strong></p>

<p>Using a custom font in XAML is very straightforward. You just need to set the <em>FontFamily</em> property to the font file path followed by a hash (#) and the font name:</p>

              <p>Before I start with the actual arguments I feel a need to state my background first so you do not mistake me with just another hater rattling about things he does not know. I have been a long time .NET developer, I have worked with winforms, webforms, mvc, compact framework. I really like C# and love F#. In February I started to work as a full time Windows Phone developer. Although I have been programming exclusively for Windows 8 for the last few months I have a ton of experience with Windows Phone programming.</p>

<p><strong>Good old Windows Phone 7 times</strong></p>

<p>I really like Windows Phone 7 as a programmer. Although capabilities of this mobile OS are very limited compared to other platforms, the things you can do can be done easily and reliably. The OS is based on Silverlight, which is a mature platform. Everything works as you would expect.</p>

<p><strong>The abomination called Windows Phone 8</strong></p>

<p>When I first got my hands on a Windows Phone 8 phone I was really disappointed. I wrote two concrete post about <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/store-region-messed-up-in-windows-phone-8/">troubles with Windows Phone Store region</a> and an <a href="http://blog.kulman.sk/htc-8x-windows-phone-8-and-playing-music/">unaccountable approach to MP3 tags</a> but lets take it more generally. Windows Phone 8 feels like Windows Phone 7 written from scratch using another technology, visually looking nearly the same but full of bugs and unfinished things. I am really amazed at things that worked on Windows Phone 7 but work much worse on Windows Phone 8. I thought that only Czech and Slovak people suffered from the &#8220;not invented here&#8221; syndrome but clearly it might be a more widespread disease.</p>

              <p>I use my Nokia Lumia 800 also as a music player, with a few annoyances but nothing I could not live with. When I tried to use the HTC 8X with Windows Phone 8 as a music player, the situation was quite different.</p>

<p>The first thing that annoys me is more of a HTC&#8217;s fault than Windows Phone&#8217;s. The HTC 8X has Beats Audio. It does not really say what it is or does, it just says it is there. Every time you plug in your headset, a notification sound is played and a toast appears informing you that the Beats Audio is on. You can disable the sound only using the disable all other notifications option in settings, so you may loose some notifications you need. Disabling the toast is impossible. I naively thought that if I disable the Beats Audio completely the notification goes away. Silly me. The notifications just changes from Beats Audio on to Beats Audio off every damn time you plug in your headset.</p>

              <p>If you use Windows Phone 7, your region for the Windows Phone Store is determined by the region of your Live ID you use with the phone. The region of your Live ID cannot be changed, so if you move to another country or just want to access apps that are not available in your country there is nothing you can to about it. Changing region in your phone does not help.</p>

<p>The situation in Windows Phone 8 is different, more messed up. When I got my hands on the HTC 8X with Windows Phone 8, I logged with my Slovak LiveID. The Windows Phone Store showed apps available in Slovakia and I had no access to music or podcasts as expected. I listen to podcasts every day so I have an US Live ID I use with my Lumia 800 (and nowhere else and cannot be &#8220;merged&#8221; with my primary Live ID).</p>
