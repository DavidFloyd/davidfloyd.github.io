In this installment of the series I will show you how user data services. We will finally use the Unity DI container that is part of the project setup.

**Data and Services**

In next installment we will be showing a list of products, so let&#8217;s create a simple Product class first in the Data directory:

{{< gist 6606102>}}

PropertyChangedBase is a base class implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged interface and the ImplementPropertyChanged attribute makes sure it&#8217;s method is called for all the property changes. (More about Fody [here][1])

All the operations will be handled by a service implementing the IProductService interface:

{{< gist 6606127>}}

You can implement this interface any way you want. To keep things simple I chose an implementation with two hardcoded products:

{{< gist 6606170>}}

**Registering services**

All our services need to be registered with the Unity DI container before being used. The place to do it is the App class (App.xaml.cs file). You can override the Configure method to do it:

{{< gist 6607482>}}

This registers the ProductService class to the IProductService interface. The new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager() parameter is Unity&#8217;s way of setting the registration to be a singleton.

**Injecting services into ViewModel**

Injecting the ProductService into our MainViewModel is very simple. Just declare a IProductService variable and initialize it from constructor. Unity will take care of the rest:

{{< gist 6607538>}}

Next time we will implement a typical master-detail scenario showing products usign the ProductService whe have created. All the code is again [available at GitHub][2].
