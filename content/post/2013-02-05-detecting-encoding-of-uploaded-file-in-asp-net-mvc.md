Uploading a file in ASP.NET MVC is very easy, but there is no easy way to detect the encoding of a uploaded text file. However you can use the fact if you try to read the file with a wrong encoding, you get an DecoderFallbackException. So how do you put everything together?

First, get a stream of the uploaded file.

Next, read the whole file to a byte array

Finally the trick is to try all the encodings you think the file may be in and chech if if fails or not
