Windows Phone 8.1 XAML contains a Pivot control that looks like the one from Windows Phone 7/8 and also should behave the same way, but does not. You will find the first problem with the new Pivot when you want to change the PivotItem header color.

**Windows Phone 7/8**

If you want to change the PivotItem header color in Windows Phone 7/8, you just define the color in the Header template:

<div data-gist="a49d0c7d471c4de42521" data-file="wp8.xaml"></div>

This works great, changing the color of the active PivotItem Header to the color you want and applying some opacity to the inactive PivotItem Headers.

{{% img-responsive "/images/header78.png" %}}

**Windows Phone 8.1 XAML**

If you apply the same Header template to PivotItem in Windows Phone 8.1 XAML, you will find that there is a bug in the control. The inactive PivotItem Headers do not get opacity change applied.

{{% img-responsive "/images/header81.png" %}}

This is obviously a problem, if you do not want to do same SelectedIndex manipulation to change the color programatically for all the inactive PivotItem headers. 

Luckily, there is a way to fix this. You can redefine the PivotHeaderForegroundUnselectedBrush and PivotHeaderForegroundSelectedBrush to the active and inactive colors of your choice.

<div data-gist="a49d0c7d471c4de42521" data-file="wp81.xaml"></div>
