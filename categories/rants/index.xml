      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few months I have been noticing a huge decline in software quality on every device I use. It seems to me like bad quality software is a current trend, especially for big corporations like Microsoft or Apple. Even though I consider Apple more of a &amp;ldquo;fashion company&amp;rdquo; than a &amp;ldquo;technology company&amp;rdquo; I think it is unacceptable for software from such big companies to works as bad as it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am programmer so I know that software has and always will have bugs. My points is not buggy software in general but that software contains more bugs with every release and that stay unfixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;windows-10&#34;&gt;Windows 10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 updates are where I notice the software quality degradation the most. I cannot remember a bigger Windows 10 update that did not break something for me or millions of other users (like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/76719/microsoft-broken-millions-webcams-windows-10-anniversary-update&#34;&gt;Anniversary Update breaking millions of webcams&lt;/a&gt;). I do think this is because of my hardware configuration. I experience all the problem usually on both my laptop and my desktop computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Thank you &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Windows&#34;&gt;@Windows&lt;/a&gt; 10 for promptly installing all updates without asking and deleting all my unsaved changes üí©.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Tomas Petricek (@tomaspetricek) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tomaspetricek/status/789495984682364928&#34;&gt;October 21, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst thing about Windows updates is that you cannot refuse them and not install them. They will install if you want them or not. You just need to leave your computer for a minute and Windows 10 will install updates that will break something. In an ideal scenario you may not loose your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example the latest update from last week made Windows 10 on my laptop think that I have 4 extra displays and Windows 10 now sometimes decides to open a window on one of those non-existent displays so I cannot get to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;This is fascinating. Mostly because I only have one display connected to my PC. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/dRltAVa8yz&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/dRltAVa8yz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/thurrott/status/788074304533594117&#34;&gt;October 17, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some login issues. If I turn on my laptop at work, connect it to an external display and connect a keyboard or mouse when on the login screen, Windows 10 decides I entered a password and starts a login attempt that never ends. I have to put the computer to sleep and wake it up again to be able to login.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue like reseting default app settings, Store icon being put back to taskbar or changed items in the Start menu are now common. And I am using the &amp;ldquo;stable&amp;rdquo; build, not an Insider Preview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rather not mention Windows 10 Mobile in a great detail. Microsoft took a fast, fluid and good looking mobile OS (Windows Phone 7) and turned it into an abomination where not even system apps work. Sure, it shows that Windows 10 is primarily developed for desktops and the mobile version only exist so they do not openly admit a failure in this segment. I am sure Microsoft employees must be given iPhones now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Can somebody please tell the intern who programs Windows Store on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Windows10Mobile?src=hash&#34;&gt;#Windows10Mobile&lt;/a&gt; to use he whole screen already? &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/tLfdkbefQq&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/tLfdkbefQq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Igor Kulman (@igorkulman) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/igorkulman/status/767635667471982592&#34;&gt;August 22, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ios-10&#34;&gt;iOS 10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software quality of iOS has been declining since iOS 7 but it is most visible in iOS 10. It is another update where Apple added a bunch of new features to have something to show at the keynote, keeping all the old bugs and adding some new ones. For me iOS 10 was the first iOS update (since iOS 7) that did not succeed, my iPhone ended in a state where I had to download and install iTunes (which is another kind of software hell on Windows) and restore with a new update attempt over the wire (with my nearly broken lightning cable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ios10?src=hash&#34;&gt;#ios10&lt;/a&gt; bug: using U.S. English as phone language, a different national Regional Format (like Italy) won&amp;#39;t work (e.g. date format) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/fail?src=hash&#34;&gt;#fail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ale Di Cicco ‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ (@aledicicco) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/aledicicco/status/776369944351170560&#34;&gt;September 15, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes Apple just removes features you rely on for no good reason. Since iOS 7 I had my phone set to English as display language, Czech Republic as my region and using Slovak regional settings. That way my phone UI was in English, just showing Slovak dates and times and Kƒç as currency symbol. Apple completely removed this level of user control in iOS 10. So now when I want English as my display language I have to live with everything displaying in English. So in the morning I do not see 8:00 Pondelok on the lockscreen but 08:00 Monday (yes also with the leading zero). This is not just my problem, &lt;a href=&#34;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7663783?start=0&amp;amp;tstart=0&#34;&gt;many people complain about this on Apple forums&lt;/a&gt;, mostly people living abroad or say Canadians wanting their phones UI in English but French dates and times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Does anyone use bedtime feature of iOS 10? It works for me for 2-3 days and then stops, tried restoring device, no improvement&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; James (@jamxf) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jamxf/status/789399680614436864&#34;&gt;October 21, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about adding new features to iOS 10 I have to mention Bedtime. The idea of Bedtime, copied from 3rd party apps, is simple, making you go to band at the same time every day. But it does not work. You set the time to go to bed and to wake up in the app. In addition you set how many minutes before you go to bed you want to receive a notification. But this notification is not reliable at all. For me it is about 50% reliable and according to people complaining on forums I am not alone. How hard could it be for Apple to show a notification from an Apple system app on Apple iOS at the same time every day?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The iOS bedtime alarm feature didn&amp;#39;t go off this morning. Woke up about a half hour later good job I did.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jamie Maddocks (@ChickenStudios) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ChickenStudios/status/789024130406514688&#34;&gt;October 20, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;watchos&#34;&gt;watchOS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The watchOS running on Apple Watch is in a league on its own regarding bugs and unfinished features. Especially all the fitness features feel rough and unfinished. Take something as a simple as a reminder to stand up and move a bit when you have been sitting for a while. On my Microsoft Band (a product with great firmware but really bad build quality) I could set the reminder to only work between 9am and 6pm with a 1 hour interval. The Apple Watch only has one setting for this feature: on/off. So if you enable it, the reminder will also bug you in the evening when you really do not want to move anymore. Or the reminder &lt;a href=&#34;https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7538178?start=0&amp;amp;tstart=0&#34;&gt;can wake you up in the middle of the night and tell you to stand up and move&lt;/a&gt;. What about just allowing the user to set a time range?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleWatch?src=hash&#34;&gt;#AppleWatch&lt;/a&gt; major &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/fail?src=hash&#34;&gt;#fail&lt;/a&gt;. Wakes me up during the night to remind me to stand up?! C&amp;#39;mon Apple. I&amp;#39;d expect better than that out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Joe Da Silva (@joemagicdevelop) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/joemagicdevelop/status/598466624245657600&#34;&gt;May 13, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image having you iPhone set to enable the Do Not Disturb mode automatically every day after 11pm. If someone calls you after 11pm, the iPhone will not ring. If one of your contacts marked as favorite calls you, the iPhone will ring as it should. But the Apple Watch sees the Do Not Disturb mode and just ignores everything. It does not care that your iPhone is ringing, the Apple Watch just quietly rests on your wrist. There are so many problems like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have at least some hope that Microsoft will fix their bugs but Apple, Apple lets bugs rot for years (noticed the date of the Apple Watch tweet?). The worst thing about all this is that you do not have a choice. Sure you do not have to use Windows 10, you can use MacOS or Linux, but do you really think they are better in this regard? Or that Android works better than iOS? You are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The sad state of DVLUP (MS Tech Rewards)</title>
      <link>https://blog.davidmacias.com/the-sad-state-of-dvlup-ms-tech-rewards/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a Windows Phone developer you must know DVLUP. It was a program for developers developed by Nokia. The idea was simple. Do Windows Phone development related challenges, make your apps better thanks to them, get points, exchange points for rewards. Sounds good, does it not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interesting, but location dependent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with DVLUP was that it was location dependent. It opened in my countries maybe two years after US and developers from other &amp;ldquo;more important&amp;rdquo; countries could participate. The challenges were also location dependent, showing me only a small subset in my country. But they were interesting. They made me implement some new stuff into my apps that I would not do otherwise. And I got points for doing them. When I wanted to exchange the points for some rewards, there were not that many available in my country. No phones or other hardware like in the US. A Steam gift card was the only useful think that I could get. But I did not mind, I liked doing the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then Microsoft bought Nokia and slowly DVLUP turned into MS Tech Rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing Universal Apps too hard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, all the challenges changed to challenges for Windows 10 apps only. They do not seem to care that most of the Windows Phone apps in the Store or in the works are for 8 or 8.1. Rewriting 8 and 8.1 apps that work well on 10 is simply not feasible. To me its seems like pushing Universal Apps too hard, ignoring the developers that invested in the Windows Phone platform in the beginning and created apps before Universal Apps were a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, they will tell you that making a 8 or 8.1 app into a 10 app is not rewriting, but porting. They can even argue with you about this on Twitter. But you know better. Maybe you are fed up of rewriting, you did it from 7 to 8 and from 8.1 ..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More stupid challenges, new rules, still not good rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that making all the challenges for Windows 10 apps only made the developer participate a lot less. Otherwise they would not come with the new stupid rules. One of the rules is that you have to participate challenges with a given period, otherwise your earned points (the points you cannot spend on anything useful) would expire!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the DVLUP challenges were making you to implement unique Windows Phone features to your apps. It sometimes looked a bit forceful, but generally it was ok. Now that Windows 10 Mobile lost all of the Windows Phone unique features, the challenges are getting really stupid sometimes. Just take a look at a challenge called &lt;a href=&#34;https://rewards.msdn.microsoft.com/Challenge/1c0a75a4-e198-4d52-9be2-5f9d2279848c&#34;&gt;Give Your Windows 10 App a Festive Holiday Glow&lt;/a&gt;. Reminds me of times when people put JavaScript snow on their websites in Winter. About 15 years ago. And it looks like I am not the only one who thinks it is really stupid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Oh god no &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MSTechRewards&#34;&gt;@MSTechRewards&lt;/a&gt; please don&amp;#39;t make people do shitty stuff like this &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/Pmm4ofyT5c&#34;&gt;https://t.co/Pmm4ofyT5c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Morten Nielsen (@dotMorten) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dotMorten/status/667743323633774592&#34;&gt;November 20, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, DVLUP is dead, I really do not want to rewrite my apps for Windows 10 and add Christmas theming to them. It makes me sad it ended this way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lenovo, why do you screw Thinkpads with every update?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a Lenovo Thinpad T440s that I got about a year ago after a great experience with a company issued Lenovo Thinkpad T420 I used for about two and half years before that. I use it daily for on-site work, not so much at home, where I have a desktop computer. The T440s is thinner and lighter than T420, but otherwise everything is just worse. You cannot change RAM or disk so easily as on the T420, the keyboard and trackpoint are worse (the trackpoint does not have physical buttons like on the T420 but &lt;a href=&#34;http://camerongray.me/2015/02/fitting-physical-trackpoint-buttons-to-a-lenovo-thinkpad-t440s/&#34;&gt;I had it replaced for one that does&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did I get the T440s? Because it seemed like a wise choice at the time, compared to the competition. It has a trackpoint, fingerprint reader, a keyboard with all the keys in the right place and it is, after all, a Thinkpad, a sturdy and reliable work machine build from good materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not really. As every Thinkpad fan can tell you, the quality of Thinkpads is declining (even when not counting the plastic Thinkpad Edge computers that are not &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221; Thinkpads). It seems like Lenovo simply does not care, making the hardware worse and software even more so. Gone are the superb ThinkVantage tools, only the Thinkpad update utility remained. And it often install software and drivers that can screw up your computer. It happened to many times, this is the latest incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security BIOS update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest problem is with a BIOS update. Lenovo releases BIOS 2.35 for my T440s, fixing a &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/smm_attack&#34;&gt;SMM &amp;#8220;Incursion&amp;#8221; Attack&lt;/a&gt;. The BIOS update as pushed to me as critical using the Thinkpad update tools and fixing security problems is always a good thing. So I installed it. And problems started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I put the computer to sleep and it went from sleep to hibernation after 180 minutes (default settings), the computer started to beep madly and hung on a black screen. Not really a good sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured it must be because of the BIOS update, so I went to the Lenovo website to download the previous BIOS update. I downloaded BIOS 2.34 and could not installed it because of I strange error. Then I noticed this note in the BIOS 2.35 changelog: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;If the UEFI BIOS has been updated to version 2.35 or higher, it is no longer able to roll back to the version before 2.35 for security improvement.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;. So my computer got screwed. I had a problematic BIOS and could not downgrade. Great work Lenovo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insecure workaround&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some research and &lt;a href=&#34;https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-T400-T500-and-newer-T/T440s-beeps-while-putting-in-sleep-mode-and-a-blank-screen/m-p/2191866&#34;&gt;found out that the problem is related to the TPM chip&lt;/a&gt;. I use the TPM chip with BitLocker in Windows 10, so It looked like it maybe be the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I turned off BitLocker, waited for my disk do get decrypted and disabled the TPM in BIOS. I put the computer to sleep, waited for it to go to hibernation, and nothing happened. No beeps, no problems, the computer woke normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I have a BIOS (that I cannot get rid of) with the security fix for an obscure issue but my disk is not encrypted and when I loose my computer or it gets stolen, anyone can read my data. Again, great work Lenovo. Time to install TrueCrypt I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: it took two month for Lenovo to acknowledge the problem and release a fix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
